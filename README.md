# Boilerplate Webpack Koa React Typescript Babel

**(boilerplate-webpack-koa-react-typescript-babel)**

Boilerplate for a webpack / koa based universal react app using babel, react-router, redux, styled components and typescript.

This is a **WIP** mainly for myself to try and learn more about building my own webstack for react / koa and typescript instead of just using create-react-app.

This boilerplate uses:

- Babel 7
- Commitlint
- Convict

- Jest
- Koa
