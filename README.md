# Boilerplate Webpack Koa React Typescript Babel

**(boilerplate-webpack-koa-react-typescript-babel)**

Boilerplate for a webpack / koa based react project using typescript & babel.

This is a **WIP** mainly for myself to try and learn more about building my own webstack for react / koa and typescript instead of just using create-react-app.
