# Boilerplate Webpack Koa React Typescript Babel

**(boilerplate-webpack-koa-react-typescript-babel)**

Boilerplate for a webpack / koa based react project using typescript & babel.

This is a **WIP** mainly for myself to try and learn more about building my own webstack for react / koa and typescript instead of just using create-react-app.

## About

This boilerplate uses:

- Babel 7
- ESLint
- Jest
- Koa
- PostCSS (to be replaced with styled components)
- Prettier
- React
- React Helmet
- React Router
- React Testing Library (instead of Enzyme)
- StyleLint
- Typescript
- Webpack
